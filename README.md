## Overview
The purpose of this repo is to provide folks an opportunity to evaluate Inspect's motion functionality. Now in beta! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Contents
1. Studio file with animation
2. Basic markup and CSS to serve as a jumping off point for implementation

## Notes on the provided code
The markup and CSS doesn't require any preprocessors or build steps. There is a simple javascript function that
toggles a class `.expanded` on the `#app` div and this is used to translate the navigation in the CSS.

Run a simple server to see the code in action. Python example:
```
cd /to/the/directory
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
And then visit localhost on the port reported by the console.<br />
You can see the markup running here: https://invisionapp.github.io/inspect-motion-example/
