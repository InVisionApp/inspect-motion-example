## Notes on the provided code
We provide basic markup and CSS to serve as a jumping off point for implementation. The markup and CSS doesn't require any preprocessors or build steps. There is a simple javascript function that toggles a class `.expanded` on the `#app` div and this is used to translate the navigation in the CSS.

Run a simple server to see the code in action. Python example:
```
cd /to/the/directory
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
And then visit localhost on the port reported by the console.<br />
